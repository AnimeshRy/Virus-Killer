### Overview 
Covid19 has been hard on everyone and I couldn't come up with a theme for a new game so here it is. Virus Killer is a space shooter with the theme based on the ongoing Corona Virus.

To game is pretty simple, Shoot the Viruses floating in a zig-zag manner with the sanitizer bottle which destroys them unless the virus hits the bottle first and your chance ends.

- The Top left corner depicts the number of lives/chances the player has until the virus catches up to him.
- The Top Right contains the score of the current player.
- The lower column in the top right contains the level the player is at.
- The middle score is the high score indicator among the three lives you get.
