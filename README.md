 ## Prerequisites to run the game:
 
 + Python 3 
 + Pygame Module Installed 

### Overview 
This is my first game made with python, also wanted to understand the OOP paradigm so had too much of extra pyfiles after refactoring to keep the size of the main file less and easy to understand. 

The game is a simple one which offers 3 lives to the player and speeds up if you complete a level, the second top right counter is the level indicator and the top right is the current score indicator. The middle is the highscore indicator among the 3 lives you get. 

The game would get impossible to beat as the time succeeds though but it feels a lot of fun! 
 
All the Game Settings can be changed according to the player with the settings file included. 

### How To Run
Clone the repo with and run the 'main' file.
